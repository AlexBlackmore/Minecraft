Command block code for Minecraft

##Formatting Colour Codes

Items with coloured text have two sections of code in each file.
The top block
of code is the vanilla code for the item, including formatting symbols which
command blocks will not naturally recognize.
The block of code below is code for a sign which when clicked will set a command
block with the properly formatted code inside of it.
